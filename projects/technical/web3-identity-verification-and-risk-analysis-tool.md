Synopsis :&#x20;

* Web3 Identity Verification & Risk Analysis Tool was created as a proof of concept for the Bitcoin Talents Program, which gained significant traction. As a result, we decided to develop a fully-fledged product called Wycheck.
* Wycheck is a platform dedicated to enhancing the security and transparency of cryptocurrency transactions and verifying users.
* Our mission is to democratize address tracking and identity verification, providing users with real-time, reliable trust assessments for crypto wallets by identifying and flagging high-risk transactions, supporting both individual users and compliance teams in preventing illicit activities and ensuring regulatory adherence.
