# Automated Magnetorheological Suspension System

Jan 2021 - June 2021

Synopsis:

* My team created a fluid equivalent of the spring suspension system that sensed the road ahead to change its viscosity for the best damping effect accordingly. (Something like a spring that can change its stiffness constant, k)
* &#x20;The aim was to provide optimal ride comfort for new-gen electrical vehicles with pre-existing computational power and batteries to power the system more seamlessly.
